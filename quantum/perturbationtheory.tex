\section{Perturbation Theory}
In quantum mechanics, we are typically concerned with finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of some arbitrary Hamiltonian. This is often very difficult, as the equations involved are in the majority of cases only solvable numerically. 

However, in many situations, the Hamiltonian is only slightly different from a Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors are well-known. For example, if we apply a small electric or magnetic field to a hydrogen atom, the Hamiltonian will be a slight perturbation from the well-known hydrogen atom Hamiltonian. Additionally, the van der Waals forces between two hydrogen atoms, which are small in magnitude, could be treated as causing small perturbations on the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian. In general, if we have some arbitrary potential, around its minima it will look like a quadratic (you can see this from the Taylor series). Thus, we can approximate this potential around its minima as some small perturbation of the harmonic oscillator potential, which is quadratic.

Motivated by these examples, we will consider the general perturbed Hamiltonian $H = H^{(0)} + \delta H$, where $H^{(0)}$ is a well-understood Hamiltonian and $\delta H$ is a small perturbation. We are not going to formally define what it means to be ``small'' here; this turns out to be more complicated of a problem than it may seem.
