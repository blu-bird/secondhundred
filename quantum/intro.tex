\section{Introduction}
This series of lectures provides an introduction to quantum mechanics. They assume a solid background in linear algebra. We begin with some experimental results that led to the development of quantum mechanics. We then provide a quick summary of some major ideas of quantum mechanics. Next, we solve some well-known problems in quantum mechanics: the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom. In the process, we discuss central potentials and angular momentum.
