\part{Mechanics}
The first semester is all about the study of mechanics, the study of how physical bodies interact with their environments. An understanding of mechanics is crucial since it serves as the foundation from which the rest of physics is built.

\section{Conserved Quantities}
Aside from basic tools such as Newton's Laws or kinematics, when certain events occur we can analyze them using the conservation of certain physical quantities. This involves the use of linear momentum (that which forces are carriers of), angular momentum, and energy.
